**Resource Monitoring App**

**TLDR**: Essentially I was saddled with deploying on AWS cloud a monitoring application scripted in Python that constantly checks on resources - (memory and CPU), used, thus providing efficient costs optimized performance monitoring, automated autoscaling, security intrusion observation and a host of other use cases. The app was first dockerized and ran on local host for the sole purpose of checking that the app codes, requirements/dependencies for the app and desired base image are all appropriate and working fine for the deployment. Then subsequent steps were undertaken on AWS platform.
